# What i learned from this project 

This is my first project after learning javascript by 3 days i Learned alot from it. 

i got board form watching tutorials i asked ai to give me project ideas based on what i learned and it gave my 3 projects and unit converter was one of them.

i faced my first challenge that javacript will not automatically take user input and convert it to a number by using `document.getElementById` I leared that i have to use get user input and intialiaze with `.value`. 


```js
    let convertToNumber = Number(inputEl.value); 
```

i learned that you I have to make sure to use value to get the user input and converet it to a variable so we can preform calculations on it.

Another challenge i also faced that the result will show NAN in the result so i also learned javascript can be annoying sometimes even tho i added the `type=number` to the input i have to also convert the type to Number in javascript. 

One of the most help full things to use to debug the code was 
```js
console.log()
```


i also Learned about `result.toFixed(2)` it is used to round the decimal number for example from 8.2222222 to 8.22.  

other than that it was fun doing this project and apply what i learned not just consuming tutorials. 


I also made sure that the app is responsive
